Nothing to see here, this is just a test app for heroku










































You're still here? Go away.











































Ok, some future plans...

* Rest api to create events
** create new, edit existing(auth)
** selection options

* Authentication (something simple)
** user / pass

* Allow anonymous modification (based on creation)
* Use login info for modification if available

* RxJs frontend with JQuery Ajax
* HTML 5
* CSS3
